# YelpCamp
YelpCamp project from Colt Steel Web Developer BootCamp

Campground images are not visible because I no longer use the cloudinary account where the images are being stored and all the data in cloudinary has been removed.

This project is entirely based on the Web Developer Bootcamp project and has no changes to Colt Steele's code. 

However, I learnt a lot during this project as it is my first project with Node.js
